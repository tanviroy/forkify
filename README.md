# Forkify - A Recipe Finding Web app ü•£ üç¥

## Description
This was the final project as part of a Udemy course - [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/).
Forkify is a recipe finding web application which uses data from the [Forkify](http://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) API. While it is a fairly basic web application, it can be used as a guide to cook one's favorite dish. Beyond accessing recipes from different sources online, it also provides information on the number and amount of ingredients needed to build a specific dish according to the number of people to serve.
This project was my first real delve into JavaScript and Web Development. 

## Installation
Run the following commands in your command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanviroy/forkify.git

npm install

npm run start
```

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Jonas Schmedtmann (@jonasschmedtmann) for his highly extensive, educational and practical JavaScript Course which taught me more JS than I could have imagined, all from scratch. Deeply enjoyed this course. 
I also would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
Lastly, I would like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration - this project is dedicated to you.
